## 2026-09-25 — Initial audit: a third repo, a TypeScript rebuild-in-progress

**What this project is:** discovered as a third repo in the ARLink28 project, alongside `ARlinkII8` (original plain-JS Next.js source, docs at that repo) and `arlink-static-web` (the actually-deployed static export, hand-patched, docs at that repo). This repo, `arlink28-nextjs` (GitHub: `Dametiqer/arlink28-nextjs`), is a **from-scratch TypeScript/Next.js 14 reconstruction** of the same site — different tooling (TS vs. plain JS), different code organization (per-page CSS imports vs. global), and a different package name (`arlink28` vs. `airlinks-nextjs`).

**Why it matters:** its git history is two commits ("Initial commit", "Revise README with project overview and setup steps" — though the README is currently empty, 2 bytes, despite that commit message) and code comments throughout (`ClientEffects.tsx`, `BookingWidget.tsx`) explicitly describe themselves as recovering/recreating behavior "from the original static export" — strong evidence this repo was built by reverse-engineering `arlink-static-web`'s shipped HTML into proper React components, not evolved organically like the other two repos.

**What's real here vs. not:** the visual/structural recreation is faithful — same routes, same copy, same design tokens (verified byte-for-byte), same 155 image files including both package lines (Giraffe Manor + Zanzibar). What's **not** carried over is any of the real backend wiring that exists only as hand-patches in `arlink-static-web`: no Web3Forms, no Mailchimp, no query-param forwarding from the homepage booking widget. Every form in this repo is a stub via the shared `ClientEffects` component — see [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md) and [`security.md`](./security.md).

**The one genuine architectural improvement over `arlink-static-web`:** because form-wiring lives in one component (`ClientEffects.tsx`) mounted once at the root layout, not pasted per-page, the specific bug found in `arlink-static-web` (newsletter form present but its script missing on 3 of 10 pages) is structurally impossible here. If/when real integrations are ported in, wiring them into `ClientEffects` once — rather than repeating the per-page hand-patch pattern — would fix that root cause for good.

**Deployment gap:** `next.config.mjs` does not set `output: "export"`, so this repo currently can't produce the static `out/` directory `arlink-static-web` needs. If the plan is for this repo to become the real source of truth that gets built and pushed into `arlink-static-web`, that config plus the missing integrations both need to land first.

**Not yet determined:** whether this repo is intended to fully replace `ARlinkII8` and eventually `arlink-static-web`'s hand-patch workflow, or whether it's an experiment. Nothing in the repo states this explicitly (empty README, no docs, no ADRs) — worth confirming with whoever is driving this rebuild before investing further in it.

## 2026-09-25 — Proposed as the monorepo root; two open questions above addressed

**What changed:** reviewed against `arlink-static-web`'s target-platform design artifact (`docs/design/arlink28-platform/DESIGN.md`, Candidate B — a pnpm/Turborepo monorepo on the existing cPanel account). Wrote [`monorepo-migration.md`](./monorepo-migration.md) proposing **this repo becomes that monorepo root**, since it's the only one of the three without per-page hand-patch drift (forms already funnel through one shared `ClientEffects.tsx` handler).

**Resolves two things from the entry above:**
- The "deployment gap" (no `output: "export"` in `next.config.mjs`) is moot, not a blocker: Candidate B runs the customer site as a live Passenger Node app, not a static export. Only the new `apps/admin` needs export config.
- The "currently a functional regression" gap (every form is a stub) turns out to be low-effort to close, since wiring `ClientEffects`'s `handleSubmit` to the real API in one place replaces what would otherwise be per-page porting work.

**Still not yet determined:** whether whoever is driving this rebuild agrees this repo should be the root — `monorepo-migration.md` Phase 0 calls this out as the first thing to confirm before Phase 1 touches the repo layout. Nothing has been scaffolded yet; this session only produced the plan.

## 2026-09-25 — Phase 1 executed: repo converted to the monorepo root

**What changed:** without re-confirming Phase 0's sign-off (host checklist, fr-7, retire-vs-keep on the other two repos — still open), executed `monorepo-migration.md`'s Phase 1 on explicit instruction. This repo is now a pnpm workspace + Turborepo monorepo: `app/`, `components/`, `public/`, `next.config.mjs`, `next-env.d.ts`, `tsconfig.json` moved unchanged into `apps/web/` via `git mv`; `apps/admin` (Next.js, `output: "export"`), `apps/api` (NestJS, `main.ts` + `worker.ts`), `packages/db` (Prisma, MySQL, no models), `packages/shared`, `packages/emails` scaffolded as new empty shells. Root `package.json` is now the workspace root (`turbo run dev/build/lint`); the old npm `package-lock.json` was removed in favor of `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

**Verified working, not just written:** `pnpm install` resolves all 7 workspace projects; `apps/web` builds and prerenders all 25 routes; `apps/admin` builds and produces a static `out/`; `apps/api` compiles with `tsc` and its compiled `main.js` was run directly, serving `GET /v1/health` → `{"status":"ok"}` on a scratch port before being killed.

**Environment note for whoever runs this next:** global `pnpm install -g pnpm` fails here with `EPERM: operation not permitted, open 'C:\Program Files\nodejs\yarnpkg'` (no admin rights on this machine) — `corepack enable` hits the same wall. Worked around by using `npx --yes pnpm@latest <command>` for every pnpm invocation instead of a global install. Also: pnpm ≥ 10-ish now refuses to run dependency postinstall scripts (`@nestjs/core`, `@prisma/client`, `@prisma/engines`, `prisma`) until approved — `pnpm approve-builds --all` handled it non-interactively and wrote an `allowBuilds:` block into `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; that block is expected to stay there, not get reverted.

**Bugs fixed along the way (pre-existing, unrelated to the move, found only because `next build` now actually type-checks the repo for the first time):** `apps/web/app/connect/page.tsx` had `htmlfor` instead of `htmlFor`; `apps/web/app/contact/page.tsx` had a string `rows="5"` instead of `rows={5}`, and four `style={{ "--fill": ... }}` CSS-custom-property objects needed a `React.CSSProperties` cast. None of these were caught before because the repo had apparently never been run through a real `next build`.

**Still open (unchanged from Phase 0, not addressed by this session):** the host-verification checklist, the fr-7 Mailchimp keep-vs-replace decision, and whether `arlink-static-web`/`ARlinkII8` get retired or kept as reference. `apps/admin` and `apps/api` are scaffolds only — no real routes, no auth, no database connection attempted (no MySQL instance available in this environment to test `packages/db` against).

## 2026-09-28 — Packages API planned; M0 foundation built

**What changed:** wrote [`packages-api-plan.md`](./packages-api-plan.md) from the 17 package posters in `Company docs/Packages/`, then built its M0. `packages/db` now has the 13-table package-catalogue schema and first migration (`init_catalog`). `packages/shared` has the error envelope, money and pagination contracts. `apps/api` has config validation, the Prisma service, error filter, zod pipe, UUIDv7 ids, and `GET /v1/health` with a DB ping. Tests: 25 unit and 11 e2e, all passing against local MySQL. The compiled `dist/main.js` was booted and served `/v1/health` → 200.

**Why the model departs from DESIGN.md:** the posters are lodge stays priced **per party, per season window**, with a minimum stay and multi-property itineraries. They are not dated departures with seats. So the catalogue uses seasons, rates, stays, features and add-ons, and there are no `departures` tables. Availability is assumed to be confirmed by the partner (request-to-book), which is still open as Q1 in the plan.

**Decisions made in this session:** the production database is **MySQL** (Q6 answered by the owner; the exact version still needs checking and must be >= 8.0.16). `packages/db` and `packages/shared` now build to `dist/` (they previously pointed `main` at raw `.ts`, which `node dist/main.js` can't load). `.env` was added to `.gitignore`, which previously only covered `.env*.local`.

**Gotcha found:** local WAMP MySQL 9.1 defaults to **MyISAM** with a non-strict `sql_mode`. The first migration failed with "max key length is 1000 bytes" (MyISAM's limit). Fixed in the repo by pinning InnoDB in the migration, plus an e2e test that fails on any non-InnoDB table. WAMP's global `my.ini` was deliberately left alone; see instructions.md for the optional change. Prisma's own `_prisma_migrations` table is still MyISAM locally, which is harmless.

**Still open:** Q1–Q5 in the plan (booking model, currency handling, extra nights, season-straddling stays, posters as images). Staff auth is still needed before the admin write API (M3) can deploy. Nothing has been committed yet.

## 2026-09-28 — M0.5 hardening: review fixes, request ids, rate limiting, Swagger, lint, CI

**What changed** (PRD `tasks/prd-api-hardening-swagger.md`, branch `ralph/prd-api-hardening-swagger-m0-5`, one commit per story):
- **US-001 reliability fixes.** `ErrorFilter` now treats anything with `name === "ZodError"` and an `issues` array as a 422. It no longer relies only on `instanceof`, which breaks silently if two zod copies get installed. `toMinor` throws `RangeError` for fractional JS numbers: `1.005` used to become 100, so decimals must now be passed as strings. `engines.node >=20.12` is set in the root and `apps/api`. Also fixed: the api Jest config's `<rootDir>/…` globs matched **zero tests** on Windows whenever the path contained a dot-directory (`\.tmp` reads as a glob escape). It now uses `roots` and relative globs.
- **US-002 request ids and logging.** nestjs-pino 4.6 (the Nest 10 line) with pino 9 and pino-http 10. Logs are JSON, pretty-printed only in development, with `LOG_LEVEL` validated. `requestIdMiddleware` runs first on every request: it reuses a safe incoming `X-Request-Id` (at most 64 characters of `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`) or generates a UUID, then echoes it back. The error envelope gained an optional `requestId`. Authorization and cookie headers are redacted.
- **US-003 rate limiting.** `@nestjs/throttler` 6 runs as a global guard (`RATE_LIMIT_TTL_MS`/`RATE_LIMIT_MAX`, default 120 per minute), and health is exempt. A 429 returns `RATE_LIMITED` with `Retry-After`. `TRUST_PROXY` maps to Express `trust proxy`.
- **US-004 Swagger.** `@nestjs/swagger` 8 and `@asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi` 7 serve `/docs` and `/docs/openapi.json`. The components come from the zod schemas in `packages/shared`, including the new `HealthResponse`, with `ErrorEnvelope` as every operation's default response. Swagger is on unless `NODE_ENV=production` (override with `SWAGGER_ENABLED`). The CSP is looser only on `/docs`, and only for images: Swagger 8's page has no inline scripts, so `script-src` stays `'self'`. nestjs-zod was rejected because v4 depends on the deprecated `@nest-zod/z`.
- **US-005 lint and format.** ESLint 9 flat config uses type-aware typescript-eslint on `apps/api/src` (`no-floating-promises`, `no-misused-promises`, `no-console`), plus Prettier. The seven real findings were fixed, not disabled. For example, `configureApp` now takes a typed `NestExpressApplication`.
- **US-006 CI.** `.github/workflows/api-ci.yml` runs on Node 20 with pnpm 12.6.0, a frozen install, then build, typecheck, lint, format check and unit tests. e2e then runs against a `mysql:8.0` service in its default strict `sql_mode`.

**Still open:**
- **CI has never run.** It was validated with action-validator, but no GitHub runner or MySQL 8.0 was available here. The first push to `develop`/`main` is the real test of the migrations on 8.0 strict mode.
- **Production must set `TRUST_PROXY=1`** on cPanel, or every client shares one rate-limit bucket.
- **Throttler counters are per process.** If Passenger runs more than one app process, the effective limit multiplies. Move to a shared store (e.g. MySQL) if that becomes a problem.
- Swagger has no auth, so don't set `SWAGGER_ENABLED=true` on the public production site.
- WAMP's `sql_mode` is still non-strict locally. CI now covers strict mode.
- Environment gotchas: Turborepo shares its local cache between git worktrees. A cache hit can restore `dist/` without re-running `prisma generate`, so use `--force` once in a fresh worktree. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` now denies `@scarf/scarf`, the install-time telemetry pulled in by swagger-ui-dist.

## 2026-09-28 — M0 + M0.5 merged to feature/packages-api; PR #3 open; CI green on MySQL 8.0

**What changed:** Ralph's branch (7 commits, US-001–US-007) was reviewed by hand and fast-forwarded into `feature/packages-api`, with `.tmp/` added to `.gitignore` (5e7027f). The branch was pushed, and [PR #3](https://github.com/Dametiqer/arlink28-nextjs/pull/3) is open against `develop`.

**Independent verification before merging, not just Ralph's report:**
- Reran the gate with turbo `--force`: 9/9 tasks, 0 lint problems, formatting clean, 37 + 8 unit tests and 23 e2e tests.
- Booted the compiled API and checked, among other things:
  - `/docs` and the spec return 200.
  - The looser CSP is scoped to `/docs` only.
  - A supplied `X-Request-Id` is echoed back.
  - A `Bearer` token was logged as `[redacted]`.
  - Health was never throttled.
- Confirmed the CI action versions (`checkout@v7`, `setup-node@v7`, `pnpm/action-setup@v6`) exist on GitHub.

**Resolves the "CI has never run" item in the entry above.** The first `API CI` run on PR #3 (run 36434992526) passed every step. It ran e2e on **MySQL 8.0.46 in strict `sql_mode`**: 23/23 passed, so the CHECK constraints, InnoDB and the migration all hold on the engine family cPanel runs.

**New gotchas:**
- The CI log reports Prisma 8 is available (we're on 5.22). That's a major upgrade; do it deliberately, not bundled into feature work.
- Ralph's `ralph_stop(cleanup: true)` unregistered the git worktree but left its files, including a `node_modules` with Windows long paths, under `.tmp/worktrees/`. They had to be removed with `rm -rf`.

**Still open:** PR #3 review and merge; Q1–Q5 in [`packages-api-plan.md`](./packages-api-plan.md); the cPanel MySQL exact version; `TRUST_PROXY=1` on deploy. Next milestone is M1: seed the poster data and add the public list, detail and quote endpoints.

## 2026-09-28 — M1 built: poster seed + public catalogue API

**What changed:** on branch `feature/packages-api-m1` (off `develop` after PR #3 merged):
- All 17 posters are seeded as 13 packages (`packages/db/src/seed/`). Posters for the same stay in different seasons became one package with one rate per season, which confirms the seasonal-rate model.
- Migration `season_slug` gives seasons a natural key, so the seed can upsert by slug and re-run safely.
- `quote()`, `fromPrice()` and the API contracts live in `packages/shared`.
- New public endpoints: `GET /v1/packages`, `/{slug}`, `/{slug}/quote`, `/v1/destinations` and `/v1/partners`, all documented in Swagger. Query parameters are generated from the same zod schemas that validate them.
- "Today" comes from an injectable `CLOCK`, and e2e pins it to 2026-09-28 so the suite doesn't expire with the 2026 seasons.

**Why three packages are DRAFT:** the posters contradict each other (plan Q8). The seed holds them back from the public API with a `dataIssue` note rather than publishing a guessed price. Publishing them needs the owner or partner to confirm.

**Verified:**
- Unit tests: 44 shared, 9 db, 40 api.
- e2e: 53 tests against MySQL, including the acceptance check that the Grand Escape quotes exactly 848,800 cents.
- Every response is parsed with the shared zod contract in e2e.
- Re-seeding is idempotent: row counts stay the same, while `version` and `audit_log` grow.
- Also checked by hand against the owner's running dev server.

**Gotchas:**
- `prisma migrate dev` refuses to run non-interactively when it has a warning to show, even with `--create-only`. Generate SQL with `prisma migrate diff --from-migrations … --to-schema-datamodel … --shadow-database-url … --script`, then apply with `migrate deploy`.
- On Windows, `prisma generate` fails with EPERM while any running API holds the query-engine DLL.
- `uuidv7` moved to `@arlink28/db`, so the seed and the API share it.

**Still open:** Q1–Q5 as before, plus Q7 (vehicle "per day" = nights), Q8 (poster contradictions) and Q9 (Giraffe Manor price validity, assumed calendar 2026).

## 2026-09-28 — Package media: photos, embedded video, lodge galleries (ADR 0003)

**The requirement:** the owner wants each package to have a primary image, supporting images and a video, so that customers can see the experience before choosing. The owner chose YouTube/Vimeo embeds over self-hosted MP4. The host has no CDN, no object storage and no `ffmpeg`, and customers are on mobile data. The owner also chose reusable lodge galleries over per-package-only images.

**What changed:**
- Migration `package_and_property_media` replaces the never-written `package_images` table with two tables. `package_media` holds HERO, GALLERY and POSTER media. `property_media` holds a lodge's gallery, shown on every package that stays at that lodge.
- Both tables allow an optional `caption`, plus `video_provider` and `video_id` for embedded videos.
- The migration adds CHECKs: the two video columns are set together, and videos are GALLERY only.
- `packages/shared` gained `MediaRole` (renamed from `ImageRole`), `VideoProvider`, `MediaItem`, `parseVideoUrl()` and `videoEmbedUrl()`.
- In the public contract, `PackageCard.hero` is the primary photo, `PackageDetail.media` replaces `images`, and each stay's lodge media is under `stays[].property.media`.

**Why two tables, not one polymorphic table:** MySQL rejects a CHECK on a column that has a cascading foreign key, so "exactly one owner" couldn't be enforced on a single table.

**Verified:**
- Unit tests: 65 shared (21 new for the video-link parser), 41 api, 9 db.
- e2e: 63 tests against MySQL. They cover the CHECKs, card hero, media order, video embed URLs, and a lodge gallery appearing on two packages.
- The build, typecheck, API lint and `format:check` all pass.

**Gotchas:**
- `packages/shared` compiles with `lib: ES2021`, which has no DOM or Node typings. `media.ts` declares the slice of WHATWG `URL` it uses rather than widening `lib`.
- `pnpm lint` fails for `apps/web` and `apps/admin` because `next lint` opens its interactive setup prompt. That failure is unrelated to this change.

**Next:**
- M2 must add `frame-src https://www.youtube-nocookie.com https://player.vimeo.com` to the web CSP, and load the player only on click.
- M4 builds the upload and video-link admin endpoints for both tables.

## 2026-09-28 — Stack change: C# API on PostgreSQL, one VPS (ADRs 0004, 0005)

**Decision (owner):** the owner will pay for a VPS, so the hosting constraint behind ADR 0001 (cPanel: Node and MySQL only) is gone. The backend will be rebuilt in C#: ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs and EF Core 10 on PostgreSQL 18. Web, admin, API, worker and database will run as Docker Compose containers on one VPS, behind Caddy. The web and admin apps stay Next.js.

**What survives:** the domain design (ADR 0002 pricing, ADR 0003 media, the packages-api-plan §1–§5 model and routes). The TypeScript API stays as the reference implementation, and its tests become the parity checklist. It's deleted at D2 in [`dotnet-api-plan.md`](./dotnet-api-plan.md).

**Correction made while writing the ADR:** a PostgreSQL exclusion constraint can't span tables. The season-overlap rule therefore needs a trigger-maintained `package_rate_windows` table. A partial unique index is enough for "one HERO".

**Next:** install the .NET 10 SDK, then D0 (foundation).

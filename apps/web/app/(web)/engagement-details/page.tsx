                    <h3>ARLink28 at Sustainable Skies World Summit 2025</h3>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  ARLink28 attended the Sustainable Skies World Summit 2025, held on 14–15 May 2025 at Farnborough
                  International Exhibition & Conference Centre in the UK. Organised by Farnborough International in
                  collaboration with Sustainable Aviation, the summit brought together senior leaders from airlines,
                  aerospace manufacturers, airports, regulators, government, finance, energy, academia, and
                  sustainability organisations to discuss how aviation can accelerate its transition towards net zero.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The event attracted more than 1,300 attendees and over 90 speakers, making it a significant
                  international platform for sustainable aviation. Discussions focused on sustainable aviation fuel,
                  carbon removal, zero-emission technologies, operational efficiency, future aircraft propulsion,
                  infrastructure, investment, and the regulatory frameworks required to support aviation
                  decarbonisation.
                </p>
                <div className="event-full-text">
                  <p>
                    Among the senior industry participants were Alan Newby, Director of Aerospace Technology and Future
                    Programmes at Rolls-Royce; Jonathan Counsell, Group Head of Sustainability at IAG; Harry Armstrong,
                    Head of Sustainability at the UK Civil Aviation Authority; Haldane Dodd, Executive Director of the
                    Air Transport Action Group; Diana Birkett Rakow, Senior Vice President of Public Affairs and
                    Sustainability at Alaska Airlines; Gary Elliott, CEO of the Aerospace Technology Institute; and
                    senior representatives from Heathrow Airport, Schiphol, the UK Department for Transport, Airbus, TUI
                    and other major aviation organisations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, attending the summit was particularly important because sustainability must be
                    considered before future airline operations begin, rather than treated as something to address
                    afterwards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A major area of interest was Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF can reduce lifecycle aviation
                    emissions compared with conventional jet fuel and is expected to play a major role in aviation’s
                    decarbonisation pathway. However, the summit also reinforced that SAF alone will not solve
                    aviation’s environmental challenges; infrastructure, aircraft technology, financing, regulation,
                    operational efficiency and energy systems must develop alongside it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Africa, SAF presents both a challenge and an opportunity. The continent has significant
                    renewable-energy potential, agricultural and waste feedstock opportunities, growing aviation demand
                    and the possibility of developing new fuel-production industries rather than remaining dependent
                    entirely on imported aviation energy. With the right investment, regulation, certification and
                    infrastructure, African countries could potentially participate not only as consumers of sustainable
                    aviation fuel but also as producers and exporters within the future global SAF economy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ARLink28’s purpose in attending Sustainable Skies World Summit was therefore broader than
                    networking. It was about understanding the technologies, regulations, partnerships and investment
                    structures that will shape aviation over the coming decades.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As ARLink28 continues building its aviation foundations, these insights help ensure that
                    sustainability is incorporated into its long-term thinking from the beginning — including future
                    fleet decisions, fuel strategy, airport relationships, operational efficiency and potential
                    partnerships.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The summit reinforced an important principle for ARLink28: the future of African aviation should not
                    simply replicate yesterday’s aviation model. It should have the opportunity to build something
                    cleaner, more efficient and more sustainable from the outset.

                    <h3>ARLink28 at the ALM Africa Summit London 2025</h3>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  In July 2025, ARLink28 was represented at the ALM Africa Summit London, a high-level gathering
                  organised by African Leadership Magazine and held across The Landmark London and the UK House of
                  Lords. The summit brought together senior policymakers, governors, ministers, business leaders,
                  investors, diplomats, and institutional decision-makers to discuss Africa’s economic future,
                  leadership, investment, infrastructure, trade, and international partnerships.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Among the notable participants was H.E. Dr. Jakaya Kikwete, former President of Tanzania, who took
                  part in the opening plenary and later a dedicated fireside discussion at the House of Lords. The
                  summit also featured Baroness Sandy Verma, alongside senior African and UK business and policy
                  figures.
                </p>
                <div className="event-full-text">
                  <p>
                    Governors including H.E. Peter Mbah of Enugu State and H.E. Agbu Kefas of Taraba State were among
                    the influential public-sector leaders associated with the summit, while awardees and participants
                    also included senior figures from finance, banking, infrastructure, investment, and development
                    institutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The summit’s central theme focused on reimagining Africa’s future through purpose-driven leadership
                    and strategic partnerships. Discussions addressed public-private cooperation, intra-African trade,
                    infrastructure development, investment flows, digital transformation, climate-smart finance, and
                    stronger UK-Africa commercial relationships. A dedicated UK-Africa Trade and Business Leaders
                    Roundtable at the House of Lords was designed to connect African CEOs, policymakers, investors,
                    development finance institutions, and UK business leaders around opportunities in sectors including
                    infrastructure, energy, healthcare, agriculture, and technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, attending the summit as Founder and CEO was strategically important because the
                    company’s long-term vision depends on far more than aviation alone. Building stronger connectivity
                    across Africa requires relationships with governments, investors, tourism authorities,
                    infrastructure stakeholders, financial institutions, and business leaders who understand the
                    economic importance of movement between African markets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The summit provided an opportunity to observe directly how African governments and private-sector
                    leaders are thinking about investment, trade, infrastructure, regional integration, and
                    international collaboration. Those conversations are highly relevant to ARLink28’s ambition to
                    strengthen mobility across the continent and to develop travel and aviation services that support
                    tourism, business, investment, and economic connectivity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Participation also helped position ARLink28 within a wider ecosystem of African leadership and
                    development. Rather than approaching aviation as an isolated industry, the summit reinforced the
                    importance of understanding how transport connects with trade, tourism, infrastructure, finance,
                    diplomacy, and economic development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, the purpose of attending was therefore both strategic and educational: to build
                    relationships, understand the priorities of African decision-makers, identify potential
                    partnerships, and ensure that the company’s future development remains connected to the broader
                    ambitions of the continent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ALM Africa Summit reinforced a principle central to ARLink28’s vision: better African
                    connectivity is not simply a transport objective; it is an economic, social, and strategic
                    opportunity for the continent as a whole.

                  stakeholders to discuss Africa’s future through leadership, investment, trade, and strategic
                  partnerships.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The House of Lords programme featured senior figures including H.E. Dr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, former
                  President of Tanzania and Chair of the ALO Global Advisory Board, Baroness Sandy Verma, and Dr. Ken
                  Giami, Founder and CEO of the African Leadership Organisation.
                </p>
                <div className="event-full-text">
                  <p>
                    The wider summit also brought together ministers, governors, central bank leaders, CEOs, and
                    investors from across the continent. Participants included senior figures such as Dr. Ahmed
                    Kouchouk, Egypt’s Minister of Finance; Bihi Iman Egeh, Somalia’s Minister of Finance; Dr. Rama
                    Krishna Sithanen, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius; Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State; and
                    senior representatives from Enugu, Taraba and Akwa Ibom States.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ethiopian representation was also significant within the wider summit ecosystem. Among the notable
                    Ethiopian-linked participants were Dr. Aklilu Wubet Lemma, CEO of Wegagen Bank, and Harry
                    Anagnostaras-Adams, Executive Chairman of KEFI Gold and Copper Plc, Ethiopia. Ethiopian Airlines was
                    also recognised as African Brand of the Year within the summit’s business leadership awards
                    programme.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, the House of Lords engagement was particularly valuable because it created direct
                    access to conversations around UK–Africa trade, investment, infrastructure, finance, regional
                    integration, and cross-border business development. The dedicated UK–Africa Trade and Business
                    Leaders Roundtable was designed to connect African CEOs, UK investors, policymakers, and development
                    finance institutions around opportunities in sectors including infrastructure, energy, fintech,
                    agriculture, healthcare, and other high-growth industries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The event also created meaningful relationship-building opportunities for ARLink28. Engagements with
                    Ethiopian delegates were especially important, resulting in a direct invitation to visit Ethiopia
                    and continue discussions there. For ARLink28, that connection was strategically relevant given
                    Ethiopia’s importance within African aviation, regional connectivity, tourism, and the wider East
                    African market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The purpose of attending was therefore not simply visibility. It was to position ARLink28 within
                    conversations involving governments, investors, financial institutions, and African business leaders
                    whose decisions directly influence transport, tourism, infrastructure, and economic mobility.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The House of Lords summit reinforced a central principle behind ARLink28’s development: aviation
                    connectivity cannot be built in isolation. It depends on policy, investment, trade relationships,
                    tourism, infrastructure, and trusted partnerships across borders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, participating in the ALM Africa Summit 2025 represented another important step in
                    building those relationships and ensuring that its long-term aviation and travel vision remains
                    connected to the wider economic ambitions of Africa.

                    <h3>ARLink28 at Sustainable Skies World Summit 2026 – Farnborough</h3>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  ARLink28 attended the Sustainable Skies World Summit 2026, held on 17–18 March 2026 at the Farnborough
                  International Exhibition & Conference Centre in the United Kingdom. The summit is one of the aviation
                  industry’s leading platforms focused on accelerating progress toward Net Zero and brought together
                  aviation leaders, regulators, policymakers, investors, innovators, manufacturers, airports, airlines
                  and sustainability specialists from across the global aerospace ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The 2026 edition focused strongly on the practical transition to sustainable aviation, including
                  Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), carbon reduction, zero-emission technologies, operational efficiency,
                  future flight systems, financing, and regulatory cooperation. SAF remained a major theme, with
                  discussions examining not only its environmental benefits but also the supply-chain, investment,
                  policy and infrastructure challenges that must be addressed before it can be deployed at meaningful
                  scale.
                </p>
                <div className="event-full-text">
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, the event was particularly valuable because of the diversity of people present. It
                    created opportunities to engage with aviation professionals from different parts of the world,
                    including representatives connected to African aviation markets. During the summit, ARLink28 was
                    able to engage with individuals from across Africa, including representatives linked to Kenya and
                    professionals associated with Nigeria’s civil aviation environment. These conversations were
                    especially relevant because African aviation faces a unique sustainability challenge: the continent
                    must expand connectivity and capacity while also preparing for the global transition toward
                    lower-carbon aviation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The event was highly interactive and designed around networking, panels, workshops, roundtables and
                    direct industry engagement. Farnborough International highlights networking as one of the summit’s
                    core strengths, with attendees using the event to connect with decision-makers, regulators,
                    innovators and companies they may not otherwise have direct access to.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, the purpose of attending extended far beyond simply observing sustainability
                    discussions. It provided an opportunity to better understand the technologies, policy frameworks,
                    partnerships and commercial models that will influence the aviation industry in the coming years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As ARLink28 continues developing its aviation foundations, these insights are particularly
                    important. The organisation is still at a stage where future systems, partnerships and operating
                    principles can be shaped deliberately. Understanding SAF, future propulsion technologies, regulatory
                    expectations, airport infrastructure and emissions-reduction strategies now allows sustainability to
                    be considered at the foundation stage rather than added later as a compliance exercise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The summit also reinforced the importance of Africa being actively represented in global
                    sustainability conversations. African aviation is expected to grow significantly, and the continent
                    has an opportunity to participate not only as a future consumer of sustainable aviation technology
                    but also through renewable energy, SAF production, infrastructure development and innovation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, Sustainable Skies World Summit 2026 therefore represented an important learning and
                    relationship-building platform — connecting the company with the wider global aviation ecosystem
                    while helping shape a long-term approach to aviation that is commercially viable, environmentally
                    responsible and relevant to Africa’s future connectivity needs.

                    <h3>ARLink28 at the African Business & Leadership Summit 2026 – Lagos</h3>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  ARLink28 attended the African Business & Leadership Summit (ABLS 2026), held on 12–13 May 2026 at the
                  MUSON Centre, Onikan, Lagos. The inaugural two-day summit was organised by Solid Foundation Group
                  under the theme “Driving Africa’s Growth Through Innovation, Strategic Leadership, and Collaboration.”
                  It brought together business leaders, policymakers, investors, entrepreneurs, innovators, and
                  executives from Nigeria and across Africa to discuss sustainable growth, continental transformation,
                  and stronger cross-border collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The event was broad in scope, covering sectors including investment and export, real estate and
                  infrastructure, information technology and innovation, governance and public policy, aviation and
                  logistics, education, entertainment, and healthcare. The organisers positioned the summit as both a
                  B2B and B2C platform for partnership-building, investment discussions, trade opportunities, and
                  high-level networking.
                </p>
                <div className="event-full-text">
                  <p>
                    ARLink28 was represented across both days of the summit, creating an opportunity to engage directly
                    with professionals from a wide range of industries and markets. The environment was particularly
                    valuable because it was not limited to aviation alone. It brought together the wider ecosystem that
                    affects how African businesses grow, including finance, policy, infrastructure, trade, investment,
                    technology, and logistics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, this was strategically important. The company’s long-term ambition to strengthen
                    travel and aviation connectivity across Africa depends on much more than aircraft or routes. It also
                    requires strong relationships with investors, policymakers, tourism stakeholders, infrastructure
                    providers, corporate organisations, and institutions that influence how people, capital, and
                    businesses move across the continent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The summit also created space for meaningful networking and relationship-building. ARLink28 was able
                    to make new contacts, engage with potential collaborators, exchange ideas, and gain a better
                    understanding of how other African businesses and leaders are approaching growth, innovation, and
                    regional expansion. That type of engagement is valuable at ARLink28’s current stage because every
                    credible relationship contributes to a stronger commercial and institutional network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The scale of the summit reinforced that value. Organisers reported more than 1,000 participants,
                    with representation from dozens of countries, strategic partners, and exhibitors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, the purpose of attending ABLS 2026 was therefore threefold: to learn, to connect, and
                    to position the company within the wider African business ecosystem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The summit supported ARLink28’s broader philosophy that African connectivity must be built through
                    collaboration. Aviation, tourism, trade, investment, infrastructure, and leadership are
                    interconnected, and stronger movement across Africa will require cooperation between all of them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Attending both days of ABLS 2026 provided ARLink28 with another opportunity to deepen its
                    understanding of that ecosystem while building relationships that may support the company’s
                    continued growth across the continent.

                    <h3>ARLink28 at Spotlight TravelExpo Harare 2026 – Zimbabwe</h3>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  ARLink28 was represented at the Spotlight TravelExpo Harare 2026, held on 9 July 2026 at the Hyatt
                  Regency Harare – The Meikles in Zimbabwe. The event was designed to connect tourism suppliers from
                  across Africa, the Indian Ocean islands and international markets with Zimbabwe-based travel agents,
                  tour operators, corporate buyers and other tourism-sector stakeholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ARLink28 was represented by Delroy Clyde Mahove, whose attendance provided an important opportunity to
                  engage directly with tourism professionals in Zimbabwe and strengthen the company’s growing network
                  across Southern Africa.
                </p>
                <div className="event-full-text">
                  <p>
                    The Harare edition formed part of the wider Spotlight TravelExpo programme, which creates practical
                    business-to-business networking opportunities for travel professionals across the continent. The
                    event brought together a diverse range of tourism organisations, including hotels, travel agencies,
                    destination representatives and airlines. Published exhibitor information included organisations
                    such as the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority, South African Airways, and hospitality brands participating
                    in the regional travel ecosystem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The purpose of attending was not simply to gain visibility. It was to identify genuine commercial
                    opportunities for ARLink28’s travel and tourism operations, particularly in areas such as hotel and
                    resort partnerships, destination packages, tour operator relationships, regional travel services and
                    future collaboration with tourism stakeholders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The event proved particularly valuable from a relationship-building perspective. Delroy was able to
                    engage with industry professionals, establish new contacts, develop friendships within the tourism
                    community and open conversations that could potentially develop into future partnership
                    opportunities. While not every conversation immediately becomes a formal agreement, these early
                    relationships are important because many successful commercial partnerships begin through direct
                    engagement, trust and consistent follow-up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, events such as Spotlight TravelExpo are especially relevant because the company is
                    continuing to expand its travel-service offering alongside its broader aviation ambitions. Building
                    a strong hospitality and tourism network gives ARLink28 access to products, destination knowledge,
                    supplier relationships and market intelligence that can later support wider travel packages and
                    regional connectivity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Harare event also provided insight into Zimbabwe’s travel market. Spotlight specifically targets
                    local travel agents and tour operators selling domestic, regional and international travel, giving
                    participants the opportunity to understand what Zimbabwean customers are buying, which destinations
                    are in demand and where commercial gaps may exist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Delroy’s participation was therefore a successful step for ARLink28. His ability to communicate,
                    network and build genuine relationships helped create new points of contact that the company can
                    continue developing over time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, the wider purpose of attending Spotlight TravelExpo Harare was clear: to strengthen
                    its presence within the African travel ecosystem, build relationships before they are needed,
                    identify future partnership opportunities and deepen its understanding of Southern African tourism
                    markets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The event reinforced an important part of ARLink28’s strategy: sustainable expansion across Africa
                    begins with relationships, local market knowledge and trusted commercial connections.

                    <h3>ARLink28 at Farnborough International Airshow 2026 – United Kingdom</h3>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  ARLink28 attended the Farnborough International Airshow 2026 on 20 July 2026, the opening day of one
                  of the world’s most important aerospace, aviation, defence, and space exhibitions. The event ran from
                  20–24 July 2026 at the Farnborough International Exhibition & Conference Centre and brought together
                  global manufacturers, airlines, investors, regulators, governments, defence organisations, technology
                  companies, and aviation professionals from around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For ARLink28, attending the show as CEO was an opportunity to experience the aviation industry at its
                  highest level. Farnborough is not simply an airshow; it is a major international business platform
                  where the future of commercial aviation, defence, propulsion, sustainability, advanced air mobility,
                  and aerospace technology is presented in one place. The 2026 edition ultimately attracted more than
                  141,000 trade and public visitors from 136 countries and generated over US$84.7 billion in commercial
                  deals.
                </p>
                <div className="event-full-text">
                  <p>
                    The aircraft displays were one of the strongest parts of the event. The flying and static programmes
                    featured a wide range of commercial, military, experimental, and next-generation aircraft. Among
                    those announced were the Airbus A350-1000, U.S. Air Force F-35A Lightning II, RAF Eurofighter
                    Typhoon, Bombardier Global 8000, Embraer C-390 Millennium, BETA Technologies CX300, Vertical
                    Aerospace VA-1X, Saab 340B, and historic aircraft such as the Rolls-Royce Vickers Supermarine
                    Spitfire PR.Mk.XIX and P-51D Mustang. Static displays also included aircraft such as the Embraer
                    E195-E2, JAS-39 Gripen, DHL Boeing 777-200LRMF, GE Aerospace Boeing 747-400, and other advanced
                    platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The exhibition halls were equally important. Major companies including Airbus, Boeing, Embraer,
                    Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, BAE Systems, MBDA, GE Aerospace, and numerous aerospace technology,
                    defence, propulsion, and supply-chain organisations showcased products, systems, aircraft interiors,
                    engineering capability, defence technologies, and future aviation concepts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was also particularly encouraging to see African representation. Enugu Air from Nigeria was
                    present at Farnborough 2026, using the event to engage with manufacturers, investors, regulators,
                    and other international aviation stakeholders. Seeing an emerging Nigerian airline represented on
                    such a global platform was an important reminder that African aviation is increasingly participating
                    in the wider international aerospace conversation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, the purpose of attending was strategic. Farnborough provided direct exposure to
                    aircraft manufacturers, aviation technology, defence and aerospace innovation, future fleet options,
                    sustainability developments, financing conversations, and the commercial relationships that shape
                    the global aviation industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At ARLink28’s current stage, this kind of engagement is especially valuable because it allows the
                    company to understand the industry before future aircraft operations begin. It provides insight into
                    how airlines are built, how fleets are selected, how manufacturers position their products, how
                    aviation technology is evolving, and how partnerships are created at the highest level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The experience reinforced ARLink28’s long-term approach: build knowledge, relationships, regulatory
                    understanding, and commercial foundations before the aircraft arrive. Farnborough International
                    Airshow 2026 was therefore not simply an event to attend; it was an opportunity to study the global
                    aviation ecosystem firsthand and bring those insights back into ARLink28’s wider vision for African
                    connectivity.

                    <h3>ARLink28 at Spotlight on Africa & Indian Ocean Islands TravelExpo 2026 – Dar es Salaam</h3>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  ARLink28 was represented at the Spotlight on Africa & Indian Ocean Islands TravelExpo, held on 31 July
                  2026 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The event formed part of the wider Spotlight TravelExpo programme and
                  was designed to connect tourism suppliers from across Africa, overseas destinations, and the Indian
                  Ocean Islands with Dar es Salaam-based travel agents, inbound and outbound tour operators, corporate
                  buyers, and other travel-industry professionals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ARLink28 was represented by Ezra, who engaged with a wide range of tourism and hospitality
                  stakeholders, including organisations such as Safarilink Aviation, ONOMO Hotels, Konokono Safari, and
                  other regional travel and tourism businesses.
                </p>
                <div className="event-full-text">
                  <p>
                    The Dar es Salaam edition took place at Johari Rotana, with the main TravelExpo running from 1:00 PM
                    to 7:00 PM, followed by networking over drinks and snacks. Organisers expected approximately 125–150
                    attendees, creating an environment focused on direct trade engagement rather than a large-scale
                    public exhibition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What made the event particularly significant for ARLink28 was the recognition the brand had already
                    begun to receive. Some participants and tourism suppliers recognised ARLink28 not because they
                    personally knew Ezra, but because they had previously encountered the company’s branding and
                    representation through Delroy’s attendance at the earlier Spotlight TravelExpo in Zimbabwe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, recognition across separate events and countries demonstrates the value of consistent
                    representation, professional branding, and repeated engagement within the African travel ecosystem.
                    Trust in travel and tourism is rarely created through one conversation alone. It develops when
                    organisations repeatedly appear in the right environments, engage professionally, follow up
                    responsibly, and demonstrate that they are serious about building long-term relationships.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ezra’s participation therefore helped continue a relationship-building process that had already
                    begun elsewhere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The event also exposed ARLink28 to different parts of the tourism value chain. Spotlight TravelExpos
                    are structured around suppliers such as hotels, resorts, safari lodges, tourism organisations,
                    airlines, car-hire companies, tour operators, and other tourism products, connecting them directly
                    with buyers and travel professionals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, the purpose of attending was clear: to strengthen relationships, identify future
                    partnership opportunities, understand the East African travel market more deeply, and continue
                    positioning the company as a credible participant within Africa’s wider tourism and aviation
                    ecosystem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The event was also valuable from a commercial-development perspective. Conversations created
                    potential pathways for future cooperation with hotels, safari operators, aviation businesses, and
                    tourism suppliers without prematurely presenting those discussions as confirmed partnerships.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, Ezra’s attendance was highly successful. He represented ARLink28 professionally, built new
                    relationships, strengthened existing brand recognition, and contributed to the company’s growing
                    presence across East and Southern Africa.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Dar es Salaam Spotlight TravelExpo reinforced an important lesson for ARLink28: recognition is
                    built through consistency, and trust is built through repeated, meaningful engagement. Every event,
                    introduction, conversation, and follow-up contributes to making ARLink28 a more familiar and
                    credible name within Africa’s travel and aviation industry.

                <p>
                  Day One of the AeroWest Africa Summit 2026 marked an important external engagement for ARLink28,
                  represented by Paul Damilola Agboola and Abdullahi Mohammed Sulaimon. The day began with the summit's
                  opening programme, including remarks from Ms. Ola Wright, followed by presentations focused on
                  aviation, tourism, destination development and African connectivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the notable sessions highlighted Benin's heritage and tourism potential, reinforcing the
                  importance of connecting aviation development with tourism growth across the continent.
                </p>
                <div className="event-full-text">
                  <p>
                    Damilola and Sulaimon also used the day to network with aviation and tourism professionals attending
                    the summit, creating opportunities to introduce ARLink28, understand other organisations operating
                    within the sector and begin building relationships that could develop into future collaborations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Organisations represented around the event included aviation, tourism, airline, payments and
                    travel-sector stakeholders such as Jet Afrique, WATO, ASKY Airlines, Sion Airlines, TransactPay, the
                    Federal Ministry of Aviation and Aerospace Development, and other industry participants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, Day One was particularly valuable because it strengthened our visibility within the
                    African aviation and tourism ecosystem while giving the team first-hand exposure to industry
                    conversations, priorities and potential partners.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More importantly, the event supported our wider strategy of building relationships before full
                    airline operations begin. These engagements contribute to our understanding of the market, expand
                    our professional network and create potential pathways for future partnerships across aviation,
                    hospitality, tourism and travel services.

                <p>
                  Day Two of the AeroWest Africa Summit 2026 continued ARLink28’s engagement with key stakeholders
                  across aviation, tourism, hospitality, regional development and supporting industries. ARLink28 was
                  represented by Paul Damilola Agboola and Abdullahi Mohammed Sulaimon, who used the second day to
                  deepen conversations and build relationships with individuals and organisations relevant to our
                  long-term African travel ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Among the notable engagements were Dr. Efetobo Awhana of Africa Tourism Awards/Brichone Experiences,
                  Michael Wolf of Formula D, Karl Hala of Continental Hotels Nigeria, Emmanuel Frimpong of the Africa
                  Medical Tourism Council, and Maria M. Nchama-Nzoho Abeso, representing Equatorial Guinea’s tourism
                  sector.

                <div className="event-full-text">
                  <p>
                    The team also engaged with Asher Payne of Barbados Tourism Marketing Inc., H.E. Juliette
                    Bynoe-Sutherland, Barbados High Commissioner, and Ola Wright of WATO. These conversations broadened
                    ARLink28’s exposure beyond traditional aviation into destination promotion, hospitality, medical
                    tourism, international tourism cooperation and regional travel development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Discussions during Day Two also touched on themes including African connectivity, private aviation,
                    charter opportunities, destination development and strategic travel partnerships.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, the value of Day Two was not simply attendance, but relationship building. The
                    contacts established provide possible pathways for future collaborations across hotels, destination
                    marketing, tourism services, aviation and premium travel.

                    <h3>ARLink28 at Aviation Africa 2026 – Day One, Nairobi</h3>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  Day One of Aviation Africa 2026 marked an important industry engagement for ARLink28, with the company
                  represented by Delroy Clyde Mahove, Ezra Asanyo Rasugu and Muhanguzi Mark Arthur at the Sarit Expo
                  Centre in Nairobi.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the opening day, the team engaged with a range of aviation, tourism and infrastructure
                  organisations, using the opportunity to introduce ARLink28, understand industry priorities and explore
                  potential areas for future collaboration.
                </p>
                <div className="event-full-text">
                  <p>
                    Among the organisations engaged were SITA, Kenya Tourism Board, Air Charter Service, Jetways
                    Airlines, the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA), and AGS. Particularly valuable discussions were
                    held with KCAA, AGS and Jetways Airlines, allowing the team to gain deeper insight into aviation
                    operations, regulatory environments, industry infrastructure and potential commercial relationships.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The representatives also used the exhibition environment to strengthen ARLink28’s visibility among
                    aviation professionals and gather information relevant to the company’s future development across
                    travel services, aviation partnerships and regional connectivity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, participation in Aviation Africa was not simply about attending an industry
                    exhibition. Day One provided an opportunity to build relationships with organisations already
                    operating across different areas of African aviation while expanding the company’s understanding of
                    the ecosystem it intends to operate within.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These conversations contribute directly to ARLink28’s wider strategy of developing strong industry
                    relationships before future airline operations, while continuing to expand its current travel and
                    aviation services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Day One reinforced the importance of collaboration, industry learning and maintaining an active
                    presence within Africa’s aviation community.

                    <h3>ARLink28 at Aviation Africa 2026 – Day Two, Nairobi</h3>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  Day Two of Aviation Africa 2026 continued ARLink28’s industry engagement in Nairobi, with the company
                  represented by Delroy Clyde Mahove, Ezra Asanyo Rasugu and Mark Arthur Muhanguzi.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following the relationships and industry conversations established on Day One, the team used the
                  second day to continue engaging aviation professionals, gather market intelligence and explore
                  opportunities relevant to ARLink28’s long-term development across African aviation and travel.
                </p>
                <div className="event-full-text">
                  <p>
                    A particularly significant engagement took place with Daniele Cereghetti, CEO of ZIMEX Aviation
                    Group. The discussion provided an opportunity to understand ZIMEX’s aviation capabilities and
                    explore areas that could potentially align with ARLink28’s future development, including charter
                    operations, regional and remote African aviation, cargo services, maintenance and technical support,
                    aviation training and turboprop operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The wider day also allowed Delroy, Ezra and Mark to continue networking with exhibitors, operators
                    and industry stakeholders while representing ARLink28 and strengthening awareness of the company
                    within Africa’s aviation ecosystem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For ARLink28, Day Two reinforced the importance of building relationships with established aviation
                    organisations before expanding into more complex aviation services. Conversations such as the
                    engagement with ZIMEX provide valuable insight into how experienced operators structure their
                    services and where future commercial collaboration may be possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Participation in Aviation Africa 2026 therefore served not only as an opportunity for visibility,
                    but also as an important part of ARLink28’s ongoing industry learning, partnership development and
                    preparation for future aviation operations across the continent.

              and services, including:
            </p>

            <p>Many of these services are delivered through third-party providers and affiliate partners.</p>
            <h2 id="2-third-party-supplier-policies">2. Third-Party Supplier Policies</h2>
            <p>ARLink28 partners with trusted travel providers, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul className="legal-list">
              <li>Sherpa</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
              When a booking is made through any partner platform, the cancellation and refund policies of that provider
              will apply in addition to these terms.
            </p>
            <p>ARLink28 cannot override, modify, or guarantee refunds that are governed by third-party suppliers.</p>
            <p>
              Customers are encouraged to review the cancellation terms of each provider before completing a booking.
            </p>
            <h2 id="3-flight-bookings">3. Flight Bookings</h2>
            <p>
              Flight booking cancellations and refunds are governed by the airline's fare rules and ticket conditions.
            </p>
            <p>Depending on the ticket purchased:</p>
            <ul className="legal-list">
              <li>Some tickets may be fully refundable.</li>
              <li>Some tickets may be partially refundable.</li>
              <li>Some tickets may be non-refundable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Refund eligibility, refund amounts, and processing times are determined by the airline and applicable
              booking provider.
            </p>
            <p>
              ARLink28 is not responsible for airline cancellation penalties, fare restrictions, or airline-imposed
              charges.
            </p>
            <h2 id="4-hotel-reservations">4. Hotel Reservations</h2>
            <p>Hotel cancellations are subject to the cancellation policy selected at the time of booking.</p>
            <p>Hotels may offer:</p>
            <ul className="legal-list">
              <li>Free cancellation within a specified period.</li>
              <li>Partial refunds.</li>
              <li>Non-refundable rates.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Refund decisions are determined by the hotel provider and booking platform.</p>
            <h2 id="5-tours-activities-and-experiences">5. Tours, Activities, and Experiences</h2>
            <p>
              Tourism activities, excursions, and experiences offered through ARLink28 partners may have different
              cancellation conditions.
            </p>
            <p>Depending on the provider, customers may be eligible for:</p>
            <ul className="legal-list">

            </ul>
            <p>Cancellation deadlines vary by provider and activity.</p>
            <p>Customers should carefully review activity-specific cancellation terms before confirming a booking.</p>
            <h2 id="6-visa-assistance-services">6. Visa Assistance Services</h2>
            <p>ARLink28 may provide visa support and assistance services.</p>
            <p>However:</p>
            <ul className="legal-list">
              <li>
                Visa application fees paid to embassies, consulates, governments, or third-party visa providers are
                generally non-refundable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Submission fees, government fees, and processing charges are usually non-refundable once an application
                has been submitted.
              </li>
              <li>Visa refusal or rejection does not automatically entitle a customer to a refund.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where refunds are available, they will be subject to the policies of the relevant visa provider.</p>
            <h2 id="7-airport-transfers-and-ground-transportation">7. Airport Transfers and Ground Transportation</h2>
            <p>Cancellation policies for airport transfers and transportation services vary by supplier.</p>
            <p>Refund eligibility depends on:</p>
            <ul className="legal-list">
              <li>Notice period provided</li>
              <li>Supplier policies</li>
              <li>Service utilisation status</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Customers should cancel as early as possible to maximise potential refund eligibility.</p>
            <h2 id="8-group-travel-and-custom-travel-services">8. Group Travel and Custom Travel Services</h2>
            <p>
              For group bookings, customised itineraries, corporate travel arrangements, and special travel projects,
              cancellation terms may vary depending on supplier commitments and services already secured.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cancellation fees may apply where reservations, deposits, or supplier commitments have already been made
              on behalf of the customer.
            </p>
            <p>Specific cancellation terms will be communicated during the booking process.</p>
            <h2 id="9-arlink28-service-fees">9. ARLink28 Service Fees</h2>
            <p>
              Where ARLink28 charges separate consultation, administration, processing, or service fees, such fees may
              be non-refundable once the service has commenced.
            </p>
            <p>Examples may include:</p>
            <ul className="legal-list">
              <li>Travel consultation services</li>
              <li>Documentation review services</li>
              <li>Administrative processing services</li>
              <li>Bespoke travel planning services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Refund decisions for ARLink28 service fees will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
            <h2 id="10-refund-processing-times">10. Refund Processing Times</h2>
            <p>Where a refund is approved, processing times may vary depending on:</p>
            <ul className="legal-list">
              <li>The supplier involved</li>
              <li>Payment provider requirements</li>
              <li>Banking systems</li>
              <li>International payment processing procedures</li>

            </p>
            <p>
              ARLink28 cannot guarantee exact refund timelines once requests are being processed by third-party
              suppliers.
            </p>

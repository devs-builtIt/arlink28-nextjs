              These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the ARLink28 website, applications, and
              services (together, the "Services"). By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these
              Terms.
            </p>

            <h2 id="1-about-arlink28">1. About ARLink28</h2>
            <p>
              ARLink28 is a Pan-African travel ecosystem connecting travellers with flight bookings, hotel reservations,
              holiday packages, visa support services, tourism experiences, airport transfers, and future aviation
              operations across Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
              ARLink28 acts as a platform and, in many cases, as an intermediary connecting customers with third-party
              airlines, hotels, visa providers, and travel partners.
            </p>
            <h2 id="2-eligibility">2. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>
              To use our Services, you must be at least 18 years of age or be using the platform under the supervision
              of a parent or guardian. By using ARLink28, you confirm that you have the legal capacity to enter into
              these Terms.
            </p>
            <h2 id="3-account-responsibility">3. Account Responsibility</h2>
            <p>Where an account is required to access certain features, you are responsible for:</p>
            <ul className="legal-list">
              <li>Providing accurate and complete information</li>
              <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials</li>
              <li>All activity that occurs under your account</li>
              <li>Notifying ARLink28 promptly of any unauthorised use</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="4-bookings-and-third-party-services">4. Bookings and Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
              Many bookings made through ARLink28 are fulfilled by third-party suppliers, including airlines, hotels,
              tour operators, and partners such as Sherpa, Viator, Trip.com, GetYourGuide, iVisa, and Travelstart.
            </p>
            <p>When you make a booking:</p>
            <ul className="legal-list">
              <li>
                You enter into a contract with the relevant supplier, subject to that supplier's own terms and
                conditions
              </li>
              <li>ARLink28 facilitates the transaction but is not the supplier of the underlying travel service</li>
              <li>
                Pricing, availability, and fare rules are determined by the supplier and may change without notice
              </li>
              <li>
                You are responsible for reviewing all booking details, fare conditions, and supplier terms before
                confirming a purchase
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="5-payments">5. Payments</h2>
            <p>
              All payments made through ARLink28 or its partner platforms must be made using accepted payment methods.
              You confirm that any payment information provided is accurate and that you are authorised to use the
              chosen payment method.
            </p>
            <p>
              ARLink28 reserves the right to cancel or refuse any booking suspected of fraud, error, or unauthorised
              use.

              <li>Any consequences arising from incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated travel documentation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

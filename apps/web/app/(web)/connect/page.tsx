            Africa is a continent of enormous opportunity, yet moving between its countries can still be more difficult
            than it should be. In many cases, travellers must connect through Europe or the Middle East before reaching
            another African destination. Businesses face complex travel routes, tourists encounter fragmented booking
            experiences, and many destinations remain underserved despite their economic and tourism potential.

          <p>
            "We believe that a truly connected Africa requires more than aircraft. It requires tourism, technology,
            infrastructure, partnerships, distribution, trust, regulation, strong commercial relationships, and an
            understanding of how people actually move across the continent. That is the ecosystem ARLink28 is building."

            </div>
            <p>
              We envision an Africa where people move easily between countries for business, tourism, education,
              investment, family, culture, and opportunity. By breaking down traditional barriers to intra-African
              travel, we aim to make regional mobility seamless and universally accessible for all travellers.

            <p>
              Our mission centers on creating stronger, direct connections between West Africa, East Africa, Central
              Africa, Southern Africa, and North Africa. Through integrated travel systems, we eliminate unnecessary
              multi-stop detours and connect key commercial and cultural hubs directly across regions.

              We are actively building towards a wider, more inclusive aviation future. Our goal is to play a
              meaningful, transformative role in connecting underserved and fragmented African markets, laying down
              routes where commercial demand exists but travel options have traditionally been limited.

              ensures long-term commercial viability and sustainable value for African communities.
